        <h2>Origami: How the Ancient Art of Paper Folding Evolved Over Time and Continues to Inspire</h2>

        <h2>What is Origami?</h2>
        <h3>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</h3>
<br><br>
        <h3>For centuries, cultures have come up with creative ways to artistically approach, adopt, and adapt the paper craft. While many of these practices, including Korean Hanji, can be individually traced to specific countries of origin, most—including papier–mâché, a French-sounding craft that was actually conceived in ancient China—boast colorful histories that span cultures, countries, and even continents. One popular practice that has left a particularly extensive paper trail across the globe is origami, the art of paper folding.
            <br>
            Though most closely tied to Japan, origami also has roots in China and Europe. Here, we explore the practice's unique history to understand how each culture has shaped the beautiful and beloved art form.
